# PSYOP SBT

This project is a collection of data collection scripts and an airdrop of SBT (soul bound tokens) to all participants in ben.eth "PSYOP" presale

The PSYOP presale was open/public solicitation for funds for a vaguely specified ERC20 token

Ben.eth opened their day-to-day trading hotwallet "ben.eth" for anyone to send ether in the range of 0.033 and 5E. The presale end time was extended numerous times, and the 5E cap was eventually lifted. Over $7M USD of ethereum was eventually deposited.

Soliciting for presales publicly in hotwallets is a dangerous activity which typically results in the solicitor absconding with all funds.

This activity should not be encouraged.

The purpose of this SBT is to mark irresponsible users on the blockchain forever.

In the future, we will provide examples of how these addresses can be excluded from smart contract integrations (or included, because you can do whatever you want with this information)
